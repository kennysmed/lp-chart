# Little Printer JavaScript Charts

LPChart v1.1
2013-06-19

LPChart is some JavaScript that makes it easier to draw line charts. It provides a simplified way of interacting with [d3](http://d3js.org/) and is designed to be particularly useful when making publications for [Little Printer](http://bergcloud.com/littleprinter/).

Future:

* Add percentage as a y-axis type.
* Add bar chart?
* Allow for negative values.
* Allow for setting custom tickFormats.

To fix:

* When showXAxisGrid is true, then there's no padding between the xAxis labels and the xAxis line. Don't know why.
