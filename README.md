To do:

* Allow setting of specific x-axis labels, as in Google Analytics graph.
* Make the means of accessing the chart more friendly - no `d3`?
* Do something with our required default CSS styles.
* Add filled-in style.
* Allow for negative values.
* Allow for setting custom tickFormats.

* Add bar chart?


To fix:

* When showXAxisGrid is true, then there's no padding between the xAxis labels and the xAxis line. Don't know why.
