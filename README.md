# LPChart: Little Printer JavaScript Charts

LPChart v1.2 
2013-07-02

LPChart is some JavaScript that makes it easier to draw line charts. It provides a simplified way of interacting with [d3](http://d3js.org/) and is designed to be particularly useful when making publications for [Little Printer](http://bergcloud.com/littleprinter/).

Documentation: http://bergcloud.github.io/lp-chart/

The documentation is on the `gh-pages` branch.

Future possible features:

* Add bar chart type.
* Allow for negative values.
* Allow for setting custom tickFormats.

To fix:

* When showXAxisGrid is true, then there's no padding between the xAxis labels and the xAxis line. Don't know why.

## Versions

* v1.1, 2013-06-19, First relase
* v1.2, 2013-07-02, Added `yAxisMin()` and `zyAxisMax()`.
